# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to host your Student Picker app on GitHub Pages (it's free!):

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "Sign up" in the top right
3. Follow the steps to create your free account

## Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Once logged in, click the "+" icon in the top right
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name it: `student-picker` (or any name you like)
4. Make sure it's set to **Public**
5. Check the box "Add a README file"
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Upload Your Files
1. In your new repository, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop these two files:
   - `index.html` (the main app file)
   - `README.md` (the documentation)
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your repository, click "Settings" (top menu)
2. Scroll down and click "Pages" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Under "Branch", select "main" (or "master")
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

## Step 5: Access Your App
1. Go back to "Settings" → "Pages"
2. You'll see a message: "Your site is live at https://[your-username].github.io/student-picker/"
3. Click that link - this is your permanent URL!
4. **Bookmark this URL** or add it to your iPhone home screen

## Step 6: Add to iPhone Home Screen
1. Open the GitHub Pages URL in Safari on your iPhone
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow pointing up)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Give it a name like "Student Picker"
5. Tap "Add"
6. Now you have an app icon on your home screen!

## Updating the App
If you ever need to update the app:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on `index.html`
3. Click the pencil icon (Edit)
4. Make your changes
5. Click "Commit changes"
6. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh your app URL

## Troubleshooting
- **App not loading?** Wait a few minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
- **Changes not showing?** Clear your browser cache or wait a few minutes
- **Lost your URL?** Go to Settings → Pages to find it again

## Your Data is Safe
- All your student pick counts and lunch history are saved in your browser
- This data stays on YOUR device (not on GitHub)
- As long as you use the same URL, your data persists
- The data will stay saved until the end of school and beyond!

That's it! Once set up, you can access your app from anywhere using the GitHub Pages URL.
